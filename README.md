This project is a simple yet engaging animation of an aquarium, created as part of my early coding practice. The goal was to bring a virtual underwater world to life by animating various elements such as fish, plants, and decorations within an aquarium container. By using HTML for structure and CSS for animations, I was able to make the fish swim and plants sway, mimicking the motion found in real aquariums.

The project was an exciting challenge, especially when it came to implementing animation techniques like keyframes, transform, and transitions. The process taught me how to create interactive and visually appealing elements that respond to user actions. This was my first hands-on experience with CSS animations, and I look forward to improving my skills to develop even more dynamic and interactive projects in the future!

This is a fun reminder that even simple projects can lead to big improvements in understanding coding concepts ðŸ’“
